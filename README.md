# About-ME-

### 👋 Hi, I’m Ukhona Sibutha

I’m a driven and curious learner with a growing passion for **technology, business, and leadership**, and how these fields intersect to solve real-world problems.

I’m currently:

* ☁️ **Participating in the AWS re/Start Program**, where I’m building strong foundations in cloud computing, IT support, Linux, networking, security fundamentals, and professional readiness
* 🎓 A **second-year UNISA student**, pursuing a **BCom in Business Informatics**, which allows me to blend technical thinking with business strategy while developing strong skills in **problem-solving, teamwork, responsibility, and time management**

I enjoy working on structured, practical projects that challenge me to think critically and continuously improve, and I value environments that encourage learning, collaboration, and growth.

My interests include:

* 💻 Cloud computing & emerging technologies
* 📊 Business analysis, accounting & operations
* 🌱 Leadership, service, and personal development

In the long term, I aim to **build purpose-driven businesses**, create opportunities for others, and use technology as a tool for meaningful community impact.

I believe in learning by doing, staying consistent, and showing up with intention.

📫 *Let’s connect, collaborate, and build something impactful.*



This is already giving *focused, future cloud leader* energy 🚀
